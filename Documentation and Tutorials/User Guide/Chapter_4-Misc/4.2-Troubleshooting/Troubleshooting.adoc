= SICK Sentio App Designer - Miscellaneous

== Troubleshooting
Though we strive to provide a robust and reliable tool, users may occasionally encounter issues while using the *SICK Sentio App Designer*. This section provides guidance on known problems and their solutions.

---

=== Workspace & building

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|Build watcher does not register changes
|The watcher does NOT work for symlinked *files*; it only works for directories.
|If possible, include the parent directory as symlink.

|Multiple build triggered
|After removing a symlinked directory, the VS Code watcher still triggers the change event as if the symlink was never removed. This shouldn't have any bad side effects, except for performance (unnecessary rebuilds).
|Restart VS Code

|Name conflicts in project manifest are not validated
|Name conflicts in the `project.mf.xml` are not displayed as error and are not validated when building SAR or SAPK files. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.
|None

|Building SAPK fails
|Deploying apps to a device or building SAPK fails. In the SICK AppSpace Log output channel a message shows: `Failed to build msdd`. This is caused by a corrupted UIBuilder control-library.
|1. Close VS Code. +
2. Delete `%APPDATA%\SICK\AppSpace\ui-builder\control-library\<version>` (e.g. `5.0.2`). +
3. Restart VS Code (UIBuilder reinstalls the control-library; takes a moment.)
|===

=== Language server

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|Custom path structure not loaded
|Directories defined by `Lua.workspace.library` are not loaded.
|Place Lua code inside an additional `scripts` folder.

|No effect of certain `Lua.format.*` options
|The old formatter was replaced by a new one including the settings options.
|Use `Lua.format.defaultConfig` instead.
|===

=== UI-Builder

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|Missing parameter bindings
|"Parameter Bindings" work only with parameters in the workspace. Parameters from the device are not loaded.
|-

|Unexpected behavior on shortcut
|Changed keyboard shortcuts are not respected by the UI-Builder.
|Add `activeCustomEditorId != 'sickag.ui-builder-plugin.HtmlEditor'` to the When condition in Keyboard Shortcuts.

|Unexpected behavior with edit menu
|Not recommended to use VS Code menu Edit operations with UIBuilder: +
* Cut-copy-paste uses VS Code's history, not UIBuilder's. +
* Other operations should have no effect.
|Use built-in UI-Builder functionality.

|No log output for broken MSDD builds
|No error log in OUTPUT > SICK AppSpace Build if `.msdd` build breaks.
|Open Help > Toggle Developer Tools to view UI logs.

|App not updated though build process changed
|App change not detected when switching msdd build from legacy sopasjs to new sail build.
|Delete app from device and retry.

|Issues with `sick-viewer2d` and `sick-viewer3d`
|* Click "Options" then "Fullscreen" → options menu misplaced. +
* Click "Fullscreen" → type errors "Element is not connected" and "Permissions check failed" may appear.

=== Device connectivity

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|"Failed to activate extension"
|Possible reason: VS Code closed during installation of device connectivity services; installation might be corrupt.
|If services fail to start a diagnostics webview opens; try offered solutions. +
Manual: Restart VS Code. If not resolved, reset SickConnectX: +
1. Check device connectivity log (output channel) for blocked ports. +
2. Delete folder: +
Windows: `%APPDATA%/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances/scx-runtime-win-x64-1.3.10` +
Linux: `~/.config/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances/scx-runtime-linux-x64-1.3.10` +
3. Restart VS Code.

|Device list empty after update
|Update of Device connectivity causes loss of device list/configuration. Migration from SDK 1.3.0 to ≥ 1.4.0 not supported.
|Populate device list again.

|WSL: Devices are not reachable
|USB Support might be blocked by IT; device connectivity refuses to work.
a|Disable USB capability by setting `NASRT_ENABLE_USB=false`. +
In `.bashrc`: +
[source,shell]
----
echo "export NASRT_ENABLE_USB=false" >> $HOME/.bashrc
----
Or via Windows environment variables (mandatory if VS Code not started via WSL terminal): +
[source]
----
NASRT_ENABLE_USB=false
WSLENV=NASRT_ENABLE_USB
----

=== Device / App Model

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|Device manifest not loaded
|Device must be in same network and accessible.
|* Ensure device is in same network +
* Add device IP to `NO_PROXY` environment variable

|Device manifest not loaded (SAE 1.6.x and 1.7.0)
|The device manifest cannot be loaded from these SAE versions.
|None

=== Device console

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|No output printed after (re-adding) device
|Steps: 1. View device console 2. Remove device 3. Add device again & select it → no more messages.
|Restart VS Code. +
Note: All VS Code instances with active SDK must be restarted (shared device connectivity).

|No device console output of any selected device
|No output regardless of device or restarts.
|Reset SickConnectX: +
1. Close all VS Code instances. +
2. Delete MaxwellConnect instance: +
Linux: `~/.config/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances/scx-runtime-linux-x64-1.3.10` +
Windows: `%APPDATA%/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances/scx-runtime-win-x64-1.3.10` +
3. Restart VS Code (Device Connectivity reinstalls).

=== Debugging

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|2D/3D viewer shapes are drawn incorrectly
|-
|None

|Debugging does not start
|VS Code stays in a loop "starting debugger" but nothing happens.
|Reset SickConnectX: +
1. Close all VS Code instances. +
2. Delete MaxwellConnect instance: +
Linux: `~/.config/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances/scx-runtime-linux-x64-1.3.10` +
Windows: `%APPDATA%/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances/scx-runtime-win-x64-1.3.10` +
3. Restart VS Code.
