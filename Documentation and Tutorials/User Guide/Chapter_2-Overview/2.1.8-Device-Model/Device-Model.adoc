== Device Model Configuration

In the device model configuration, users can select the device model used for code completion.

If a device is selected in the device list, the corresponding device model will be automatically selected in the device model configuration.

If no device is selected, it's indicated in the configuration view and only offline available device models can be selected:

There are three different types of device models:

* **Selected device**
* **Imported**
* **Build-in**
