== Sidebar
//TODO: Add some images here
The Sidebar is located on the very left of VSCode and contains quick access to various VSCode features and extensions. After installing the *SICK Sentio App Designer* extension, a new icon will appear in the sidebar that provides access to the main features of the extension.

We recommend moving the *SICK Sentio App Designer* icon to the secondary sidebar on the very right, this way all Designer related features can be viewed while also accessing the VSCode file explorer, debugger and additional tools.
