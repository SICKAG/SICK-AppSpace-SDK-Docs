The Editor is located in the center of VSCode and is where users spend most of their time creating and modifying application code. After installing the *SICK Sentio App Designer* extension, new features and tools will be integrated into the editor to enhance the development experience.

We recommend familiarizing yourself with the various editor features, such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and integrated debugging tools, to make the most of the *SICK Sentio App Designer*.
