2. Edit the application code and resources
3. Deploy the application to a connected test device
4. Debug the application if necessary
5. Package the application for distribution

All steps of this cycle are described in the following sections:

* xref:3.2-Editing/Editing.adoc[Editing]
* xref:3.3-Debugging/Debugging.adoc[Debugging]
