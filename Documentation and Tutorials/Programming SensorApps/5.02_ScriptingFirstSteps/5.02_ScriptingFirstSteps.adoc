= First Steps Scripting

// add "About this tutorial/article"

# What means scripting in SICK AppSpace?

1. Programmable devices have an Embedded Virtual Machine running, which is able to interpret Lua scripts.
* We support Lua 5.3, a widely spread scripting language for embedded systems.
* See details about Lua at http://www.lua.org.

2. Complete API for hardware access (I/O, Com, Sensor) is directly available in Lua without the need to change into a native language.

3. A huge API for algorithm access is directly available in Lua.

# Lifecycle of scripts

1. Scripts have a *Global Scope*, which runs every time the script is started.
The Global Scope is mainly used for initialization and registration of callbacks, which are then called in...

2. ...the *Function Scope*, which holds the main part of the application.
All functions are finally called by event notifications from the underlying system.

*Exercise: Letâ€˜s have a look on the sample "HelloWorld" and find these scopes*!

# Accessing the API from scripts in a static context

1. Open the sample "HelloWorld" after the https://gitlab.com/sick-appspace/samples/HelloWorld[download from GitLab].

2. Open the lua file "HelloWorld.lua".

3. Click on a free place in the lua file. Press *Ctrl+Space*. You will see an intelligent code completion pop up showing all accessible functions for this device.

4. Push enter and the selected item will be taken to the editor followed by a dot. More specific functions are now suggested.

# Accessing the API from scripts in an object oriented context

1. When programming object oriented, the intelligent code completion supports you when typing ":".
Change the function "Timer.start(handle)" to "handle:start()" (You are using the object "handle" created in line 24.).
+

2. The code completion provides partial matching. Type "handle:period" and the code completion presents all API entries for the object handle, containing "period".
+

3. Push enter and the code completion replaces the partial match with the correct function selected from the code completion pop-up.

# Understanding samples

1. Open the sample "Hello World".
2. A timer is created.
3. Use the handle to set properties of the timer.
4. Start the timer.
5. Register a function on the OnExpired event.
+

6. The shoutHello() function is called every time the timer expires.
7. Inside this function there is a *print()* called, which just prints to the console.

8. Test this sample by watching the Emulator console.


# Understanding samples: Digital IO
NOTE: Open the DigitalIO.zip after the https://gitlab.com/sick-appspace/samples/DigitalIO[download from GitLab] to run the App. Please read the information in the DigitalIO.lua for more information about how to run the App.

1. Create access to digital IO-ports.
+
image::media/ioPorts.png[]

2. IO Ports have names which can be found by using the code completion features (Ctrl+Space) again.
+
image::media/ioPorts_codeCompletion.png[]

3. Register a function on the event OnChange of portDI1 ("DI1").
+
image::media/ioPorts_function.png[]

4. See how IO-ports can be read and set.
+

5. Test this sample by pushing Key#1 and Key#2 on the Emulator console.


# Understanding samples: TCPIP Client
NOTE: Open the TCPIPClient.zip after the https://gitlab.com/sick-appspace/samples/TCPIPClient[download from GitLab] to run the App. Please read the information in the TCPIPClient.lua for more information about how to run the App.

1. Create an instance of a TCPIPClient.
+
image::media/tcpipClient.png[]

2. Set parameters of the TCPIPClient (e.g. the IP address of the corresponding TCPIP-Server).
3. Register a function on the event *OnReceive*.
+
image::media/function_onReceive.png[]

4. This function then receives all data which is received from the server.
+
image::media/function_handleReceive.png[]

5. Test this sample by running a TCPIP server on your PC. You should make sure that IP-Port and IP-address match to the parameters of this TCP/IP-Client.

6. See also the sample https://gitlab.com/sick-appspace/samples/TCPIPServer[TCPIPServer] if you want to implement a server on your device.

# Understanding samples

* SampleApps for SICK AppSpace programmable devices give guidance for implementation and illustrate API functionality.
* You can find them on https://gitlab.com/sick-appspace/samples[GitLab].
* To use them in AppStudio 3.0.0 (or newer): Download a project via button "download" as .zip and "import" this file within SICK AppStudio.
