= Scripts


# Overview
SICK AppSpace applications can be developed using scripts and the language Lua.
Scripting is a convenient way of creating extensive and complex applications. From within scripts, the whole API of the device is accessible and can be connected and enhanced without rigid limitations. Scripts can also be used to publish functions and events to be used as CROWN interfaces within other apps or components.

// Script lifecycle (incl. Global and function scope) are already explained in the article "Scripting First Steps" -->decide which one is more up-to-date and in which article it is more relevant

// # Script lifecycle

// This AppSpace concept is related to events. Each script is therefore divided into the so-called global scope and the function and event scope. While the global scope only runs once during the startup, the functions are normally registered to events which were raised later in the event loop and which define the application flow.

// Essentially, all code in the script which is inside a function block is part of the *function scope* and the rest forms part of the *global scope*.

// ## Global scope
// All code which is part of the global scope is executed only once *during application startup* or during startup of the AppEngine. These are usually things like serving events or functions, or registering functions to any event. Furthermore, the global scope may also contain initialization of variables and objects. But, as it runs during the startup phase, the user must be aware that the AppEngine resources must be accessed carefully since they might be not ready for use at that point. However, the engine raises the OnStarted event, which marks the point at which the engine is ready and the global scope has been run on all apps. A function registered to this event may be used to determine when it is safe to access AppEngine resources.

// For example, the following actions are performed as part of the global scope.

// |===
// | Script.register( eventName, callback )

// Timer.register( handle, eventName, callback ) |
// This registers a function of the script to an event. The return value should be checked to verify that the registration was successful.

// It is possible to register to a global event using Script.register() or to register to an event of an instance handle (e.g. Timer.register()). To register to an instance, the appropriate handle needs to be created beforehand.

// | Script.serveEvent( crownEventName, localEventName ) |
// This publishes an event to the system which can be notified within the script by the function Script.notifyEvent.

// This corresponds to a serve of an event in the apps’ properties.

// | Script.serveFunction( crownFunctionName, localFunctionName ) |
// This publishes a function of the script to the system so that it can be called from another app or another app component.

// This corresponds to a serve of a function in the apps’ properties.

// |===

// ## Function scope
// Every code in the script which is inside a function block, is within the *function scope*. So, functions are typically called because they have been registered to an event. These kind of functions are more or less callback functions. But functions can also be called from within the global scope if necessary.

// Events can also be notified inside a function.

// |===

// | Script.notifyEvent( eventName,parameter ) |
// This notifies a script event. This event is received by any other app or component which has registered to it.

// It must be ensured that the event to be notified has been served before.

# CROWN to Lua data type mapping

The CROWN data types are mapped to the Lua data type, which corresponds the most for as much convenience as possible.


[cols="1,6"]
|===
| CROWN data type | Lua data type
| bool | boolean
| char |
A Lua string containing 1 to 4 bytes in UTF-8 encoding, which maps to exactly one code point. ASCII characters always lead to 1-byte Lua strings.
| int |
A Lua number. *Note that for very big and small values, the conversion from and to Lua may result in a loss of precision since Lua uses IEEE-754 double precision floats to represent numbers.* For a normal range of numbers (-2^32 to +2^32), the conversion is exact since those numbers have a direct representation in the IEEE-754 format.
| float |
Lua number. 1:1 mapping since Lua uses IEEE-754 double precision floats which are exactly the same as CROWN floats.
| string |
A Lua string containing UTF-8 encoded data. Lua is Unicode-neutral and 8-bit clean. Lua therefore does not specify or check the real string encoding but when interaction with CROWN is performed, UTF-8 is assumed and also checked at runtime. *Passing non-UTF8 Lua strings to a CROWN function or event results in a negative check result at runtime (failure) and a log message is printed to inform the developer of details.*
| binary |
A Lua string containing binary data. Lua strings are 8-bit clean, so any binary data can be put into Lua strings. *Be aware of the fact that those binary-content Lua strings may not always be passed to a CROWN function or event expecting the CROWN "string" data type. This only works if each single character in the string is in the range 0-127 (the common subset of Unicode and ASCII).*
| enum | Represented as a Lua string.
| auto |
From CROWN to Lua: int/float as Lua number, bool as boolean, string/binary as Lua string. +
From LUA to CROWN: Lua number as float, boolean as bool, Lua string to binary.
| object |
A Lua "userdata" object handle (a reference to an object in memory not further specified). Objects are not accessed directly but by accessor CROWN functions or events.
|const object |
Runtime checks are performed to ensure that the object remains constant.
| handle | See "object".
| nil | Lua nil

# Script Editing in SICK AppStudio
SICK AppStudio offers a Lua editor including intelligent code completion and code highlighting. There are also advanced debugging functionalities including the possibility to visually debug 2D and 3D data.

Applications can contain one or several scripts which facilitates the possibility of creating structured and complex applications. Script files are pure text files with the file extension "lua". They can be added to the component type "scripts" using the AppExplorer in SICK AppStudio.
