[cols="10%,40%,50%"]

| *Component* | *Problem* | *Solution*

| Device selection
| After removing and adding the same device
again, the device model configuration shows
"No reachable device selected"
| Restart VSCode (wait 5 seconds to make sure the device connectivity process is
stopped)

| Device connectivity
| sickag.device-connectivity activation fails
a| If the device connectivity services fail to start, a webview should open and perform several diagnostics.
Try to resolve the issue with the offered solutions (buttons).
Possible solution (manual):

. Check the log of the device connectivity (see output channel). The blocked ports should be listed in the log.
. Delete the following folder:
.. Windows: '%APPDATA%/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect'
.. Linux: '~/.config/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect'

| Device list
| Device list empty after SICK AppSpace SDK update
a| Either populate the device list again or migrate the configuration:

. Identify the current and previous version of the device connectivity services. Respectively the ones with the highest and second highest version.
.. Windows: '%APPDATA%/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances'
.. Linux: '~/.config/SICK/AppSpace/MaxwellConnect/instances'
. Copy the configuration file to the new version.
The configuration file can be found within the installations folder under "mwc/native-access/colax/config.json". e.g. copy the file from "mwc-appspace-win-x64-0.24.4/native-access/colax/config.json" to "mwc-appspace-winx64-0.25.3/native-access/colax/config.json"
