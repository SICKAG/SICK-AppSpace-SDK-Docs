= AppEngine framework
:source-highlighter: highlight.js
:source-language: lua

The AppEngine is part of all programmable SICK AppSpace devices and contains an event loop, libraries and drivers to control input and output data. To get an app up and running, the underlying runtime environment of the AppEngine must be launched first.

The *SICK AppEngine* is a program that can be installed on Windows or Linux machine to emulate the behaviour of a real hardware device. In *SICK AppStudio* the program can be additionally configured to include only the APIs available in the specific devices.

The following section explains how the *SICK AppEngine* functions as an emulator:

* The emulator is a type of "abstract" device that allows to develop your applications
* It includes an event loop that sends events to the application similar to real devices
* The emulator allows the configuration to a target device and thus, provides the same API as the real target device
* It includes all the libraries and device drivers of the selected target device
* The emulator needs to be connected to *SICK AppStudio* or *SICK AppSpace SDK* in the same way as a real hardware device

The AppEngine has just two aspects:

* serving functions:
** For instance, the following function is a service to send a message on the TCPIP client
connection.
+
----
TCPIPClient.transmit(handle, message)
----

* serving events:

** For instance the event _TCPIPClient.OnReceive_ can be observed by registering a callback function to it.
+
----
function handleOnReceive( data ) 
  -- Insert event handling code here end
end
TCPIPClient.register( handle, "OnReceive", handleOnReceive )
----

Every time data is received on the appropriate communication channel the engine
throws the _"OnReceive"_ event and the registered function _handleOnReceive(...)_ is called.
